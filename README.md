DIYTetris
=========

A flex/actionscript game I worked on for an advanced game design course at Simon Fraser University. This is a new fresh revisit of the classic game of tetris. I worked with 5 others and developed this unique concept where the player has the interesting challenge of drawing their own tetris pieces to solve user-generated puzzles.

My role in this project is the lead developer. I implemented the front end using the Flex sdk and integrated the xml-based backend with php services in order to allow the application to be dynamic with user generated levels.
